# System Context (C4 Level 1) — Alim / Gymi Genius

## Actors

- **Gymnasium student** — the primary user. Authenticates via Supabase Auth (username/password mapped
  through the `username-login` Edge Function, or OAuth via GitHub/LinkedIn/Spotify, or a linked Google
  identity for Calendar access). Uses Home, School, subject workspace, Planner, Assistant, Statistics,
  Help, Feedback and Profile/Settings screens.
- **Administrator** — retrieves feedback and activity artefacts submitted by students (the `feedback` table
  and `feedback-messages`/`activity-logs` storage objects). Identified via the immutable
  `app_metadata.role = 'admin'` claim (set outside the app, not user-editable). No admin UI exists in
  `frontend/src`; this actor interacts with Supabase directly (SQL/dashboard) — CURRENT — SUPABASE
  (declared; not machine-verified this pass).

## Systems

- **Gymi Genius web app** — TanStack Start v1 + React 19 application. Runs partly in the **browser** (all
  interactive screens) and partly as a **TanStack server runtime** (the `/api/chat` server route in
  `frontend/src/routes/api/chat.ts`, executed server-side, not in the browser).
- **Supabase (project ref `ucacmeadsufiedxrgqit`)** — Auth, PostgreSQL (RLS-protected), Storage, Edge
  Functions. Trust boundary: **Supabase cloud**, external to the student's machine and to the app server.
- **Local Python FastAPI backend** — `127.0.0.1:8001`, referenced only through the contract in
  `frontend/src/lib/context-backend.server.ts`. Trust boundary: **local machine** (the student's own
  computer). BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION UNKNOWN beyond this contract.
- **Local model runtime** — llama.cpp / Qwen model server on `127.0.0.1:8000`, called by the local backend
  only (never directly by the frontend). Trust boundary: **local machine**.
- **Google OAuth + Google Calendar API v3 (read-only)** — used for identity linking
  (`calendar.readonly` scope) and calendar reads via `frontend/src/lib/google-calendar.ts`. Trust boundary:
  **external**.
- **GitHub / LinkedIn / Spotify OAuth** — sign-in identity providers only (`supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth`).
  Trust boundary: **external**.

## Trust boundaries

| Boundary | Contains |
|---|---|
| Browser | Student's UI session, Web Speech API, localStorage language cache |
| Local machine | Local Python backend (8001), local model runtime (8000) |
| Supabase cloud | Auth, Postgres, Storage, Edge Functions |
| External | Google OAuth/Calendar, GitHub, LinkedIn, Spotify |

## Diagram

See `SYSTEM_CONTEXT.mmd`. Link labels: **CURRENT** = implemented and observed in `frontend/src`;
**EXPECTED BACKEND CONTRACT** = defined by the frontend's request/response contract but the local backend's
actual behaviour is BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION UNKNOWN.


## Added this pass — authenticated startup flow

Signed out → `/` → `/onboarding/language` (once, CURRENT SUPABASE flag
`language_onboarding_completed`) → `/onboarding/model` (every new browser session, CURRENT
FRONTEND sessionStorage gate `alim.ai_session.v1`) → `/home`. Guard: `_authenticated/route.tsx`.
Model preparation backend (`/api/model/prepare`, `/api/model/operation`) is EXPECTED LOCAL BACKEND
CONTRACT / BACKEND TODO FOR CODEX. Resource policy: 50/50/50 admission, 30/25/30 runtime floors —
CURRENT SUPABASE `get_ai_runtime_policy()`. Model catalog: CURRENT SUPABASE `ai_model_catalog`
(10 Qwen entries), hard-coded list is fallback only. The per-user `auto_storage_cleanup`
preference is REMOVED; storage cleanup is now the platform-wide 5-minute cron job described in
`docs/supabase/STORAGE_LIFECYCLES.md`. See `docs/sequences/POST_LOGIN_STARTUP.mmd`,
`LANGUAGE_ONBOARDING.mmd`, `MODEL_SELECTION_READINESS.mmd`, `MODEL_CACHED_SHARED_DOWNLOAD.mmd`,
`RESOURCE_BLOCKED_NON_AI.mmd`, `SETTINGS_MODEL_RETRY.mmd`, `MODEL_DOWNLOAD_DEDUPLICATION.mmd`,
`AI_SESSION_STATE_MACHINE.mmd`, `STORAGE_CAPACITY_CLEANUP.mmd`.

## Compliance, system admission, safety & peer messaging (this pass)

**Startup order (CURRENT FRONTEND / CURRENT SUPABASE):** signed out → sign in/up →
`/onboarding/compliance` (gated on CURRENT SUPABASE flag
`account_compliance.compliance_onboarding_completed`, RPC
`complete_account_compliance_onboarding`) → `/onboarding/language` → SYSTEM ADMISSION gate
(`/onboarding/system-admission`, every new browser session, sessionStorage lease
`alim.admission_session.v1`, FAILS CLOSED — EXPECTED LOCAL BACKEND CONTRACT) → model readiness gate
(`alim.ai_session.v1`) → `/home`. `account_compliance.account_status = 'suspended_pending_review'`
outranks every other route and redirects to `/account/suspended`. New legal routes:
`/legal/terms`, `/legal/privacy`, `/legal/acceptable-use`, `/legal/child-safety`. See
`sequences/SIGNUP_ROLE_GUARDIAN_CONSENT.mmd`,
`sequences/STARTUP_COMPLIANCE_LANGUAGE_ADMISSION_MODEL_HOME.mmd`.

**System admission (EXPECTED LOCAL BACKEND CONTRACT, policy is CURRENT SUPABASE via
`get_system_admission_policy()`):** max 10 admitted users; login requires ≥50% free GPU/RAM/local
disk; automatic model rebalancing preserves in-flight requests and queues new allocations; health
informs model recommendation. Effective utilisation ceiling reconciles the earlier free-floor
policy (GPU≥30% free, RAM≥25% free, storage≥30% free) with the new 75%-used ceiling as an
ADDITIONAL cap: effective max used = GPU 70%, RAM 75%, storage 70%. See
`sequences/ADMISSION_MAX10_LOGIN50_RULE.mmd`, `sequences/EFFECTIVE_CAPS_75_VS_30_25_30_FLOORS.mmd`,
`sequences/MODEL_LOAD_BALANCING_LIGHTER_ASSIGNMENT.mmd`,
`sequences/INFLIGHT_PRESERVE_NEWCOMER_QUEUE_SAFE_REBALANCE.mmd`,
`sequences/SYSTEM_HEALTH_AGGREGATION.mmd`. New route: `/system-health`.

**Content safety (EXPECTED LOCAL BACKEND CONTRACT; queue/strike tables are CURRENT SUPABASE):**
verdicts `allow | block_warning | block_suspend_pending_review | safety_unavailable | scanning`.
First CONFIRMED violation blocks content and records a warning; second CONFIRMED violation sets
`suspended_pending_review` and, for students, queues a `guardian_notification_queue` item for
HUMAN review only — no automatic permanent deletion, no guardian disclosure from an unreviewed AI
classification. `apply_confirmed_safety_strike(...)` is service-role only, never callable from the
browser. Age-appropriate curriculum discussion of history/war/medicine/sexual health is explicitly
allowed; explicit/graphic/instructional/glorifying content unsuitable for minors is blocked. See
`sequences/FIRST_SAFETY_STRIKE.mmd`, `sequences/SECOND_STRIKE_SUSPENSION_GUARDIAN_REVIEW.mmd`.

**Peer messaging (CURRENT SUPABASE reads; sends are EXPECTED LOCAL BACKEND CONTRACT):** exact
username discovery only (`find_peer_by_exact_username`, no directory);
`get_or_create_direct_peer_conversation`, `mark_peer_conversation_read`; tables
`peer_conversations`, `peer_conversation_members`, `peer_messages`, `peer_message_attachments`,
`peer_message_notifications`, all RLS-scoped by membership. Direct client writes to messages and
attachments are intentionally disabled — only the local backend, after an `allow` verdict, may
persist them via `sendPeerMessage`. Attachments: private bucket `peer-message-attachments`, hard
250000-byte limit, PDF/DOC/DOCX/JPEG/PNG/WEBP allow-list, client-side compression ladder before
upload, no authenticated direct upload. New preferences: `peer_message_notifications` (default
true), `browser_message_notifications` (default false). New routes: `/messages`,
`/messages/$conversationId`. See `sequences/PEER_CHAT_CREATION_BY_USERNAME.mmd`,
`sequences/PEER_MESSAGE_MODERATION_SEND_NOTIFY.mmd`,
`sequences/ATTACHMENT_COMPRESS_SCAN_STORE.mmd`,
`sequences/OFFLINE_MESSAGE_NEXT_LOGIN_UNREAD.mmd`,
`sequences/MESSAGING_STORAGE_RLS_BOUNDARIES.mmd`.

**Endpoints (EXPECTED LOCAL BACKEND CONTRACT, centralised in
`frontend/src/lib/local-backend-endpoints.ts`):** `/api/model/*`,
`/api/system/admission/check`, `/api/system/health`, `/api/system/session/heartbeat`,
`/api/system/runtime/release`, `/api/system/model/recommendation`, `/api/safety/moderate`,
`/api/peer-messaging/send`, `/api/safety/attachment-scan`. The browser never talks to the local
backend directly: a TanStack server function forwards the caller's already-verified Supabase
bearer JWT server-to-server; `X-Student-Id` is context/cross-check only, never an authorization
boundary; no service-role key is used anywhere in this path.

**Sign-out (CURRENT FRONTEND; sweeper is BACKEND TODO FOR CODEX):** best-effort runtime release
call while the token is still valid, then Supabase `signOut()`, then clearing the AI session,
admission lease, Google token, transient messaging state and object URLs. A heartbeat/lease-TTL
sweeper that reclaims an abandoned session's model process/VRAM, session CPU/context RAM and
temporary local artifacts when the browser closes mid-flight is **not implemented** anywhere in
this repository. See `sequences/RELEASE_MY_MODEL.mmd`,
`sequences/SIGNOUT_RUNTIME_RELEASE_LEASE_TTL_FALLBACK.mmd`.

**Data rights (CURRENT SUPABASE):** `get_user_visible_supabase_health()` (unsupported quotas
reported as `not_exposed_by_sql`, never invented), `get_my_data_summary()`, and the JWT-protected
Edge Function `delete-my-data` (`range | all_content | delete_account`, Storage objects deleted
before DB rows, caller-only, no target-user-id parameter accepted). See
`sequences/DELETE_MY_DATA_RANGE.mmd`, `sequences/DELETE_MY_DATA_ALL_CONTENT_KEEP_ACCOUNT.mmd`,
`sequences/DELETE_ACCOUNT.mmd`, `sequences/GDPR_PRIVACY_DATA_MAP_RIGHTS_WORKFLOW.mmd`.

**LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE PRODUCTION:** see `legal/LEGAL_REVIEW_REQUIRED.md`. This pass makes
no claim of GDPR or any other regulatory certification; lawful basis, DPAs, records of processing,
breach procedures, jurisdictional guardian-consent rules and cookie/ePrivacy analysis are
organisational decisions outside what frontend code can establish.
